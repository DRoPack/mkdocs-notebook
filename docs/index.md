# Code Blotter

Hey there, welcome to the Code Blotter! This is where I'm jotting down all my programming adventures, from my "ah-ha" moments to the head-scratching quirks of learning to program. It's like my personal programming diary, filled with code snippets, insights, and reflections from my journey in the world of programming.

This blotter is being developed with `MkDocs` and the `Material for MkDocs` to be an online resource after years of documenting in Microsoft OneNote. OneNote was just no longer cutting it for me as a documentation tool due to the lack of code blocks and poor search capabilities. This forced me to look for something better.

Whether you're a coding newbie or a seasoned developer, I hope you find something useful and inspiring here. Let's dive in and explore together!
