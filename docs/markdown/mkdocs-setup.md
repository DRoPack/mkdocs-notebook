# MkDocs

`MkDocs` is a static site generator that provides a simplistic way for generating documentation written in `markdown`. `MkDocs` alone has a rich feature set of plugins and themes that will handle your documentation needs. However, the user community has contributed vastly to this project and added additional packages that can be installed to improve upon `MkDocs`. One of the most highly used packages is `Material for MkDocs`.

## Python Install

MkDocs requires **`Python`** and the Python package manager (**`pip`**) installed on your system. Newer installs of `Python` will include the package manager.

[Download Python](https://www.python.org/)

After install check installation of `Python` from the command line

```cmd title="Windows cmd"
$ python --version
Python 3.12.3

$ pip --version
pip 24.0 from C:..user\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.12)
```

!!! note

    For Windows install of Python be sure to check the box to add Python to your **PATH**<br>
    (It's normally off by default)

## MkDocs / Material for MkDocs Install

=== ":simple-materialformkdocs: **Material for MkDocs**"

    ## Material for MkDocs
    
    This will automatically install these dependencies: `MkDocs`, `Markdown`, `Pygments` and `Python Markdown Extensions`.

    [Material for MkDocs Documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

    ```cmd title="Windows cmd"
    pip install mkdocs-material
    ```
=== ":fontawesome-brands-markdown: **MkDocs**"

    ## MkDocs

    This will install `MkDocs` only. 

    [MkDocs Documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/)

    Install `MkDocs` package using pip:

    ```cmd title="Windows cmd"
    pip install mkdocs
    ```

    After install check installation of `MkDocs` from the command line

    ```cmd title="Windows cmd"
    $mkdocs --version
    mkdocs, version 1.5.3 from C:...\Programs\Python\Python312\Lib\site-packages\mkdocs (Python 3.12)
    ```

## Creating a New Project

Open command line and navigate to the location where the project will be stored. To create a new `MkDocs` project, run the following command from the command line.<br>
Then use the `cd` command to change directories to the newly created `MkDocs` directory.

```cmd title="Windows cmd"
mkdocs new my-project
cd my-project
```

!!! tip
    In the example above the new `MkDocs` project was called 'my-project' but any name can be used for the new project name.

## Python Virtual Environment

`Python 3` has a [built-in virtual environment][python-virtual-env] that will isolate project packages from other projects on your system. It is recommended to **activate the virtual environment each time** you open a `Python` project to work on it. The virtual environment will cease each time you close the shell or IDE from which you activated from.

[python-virtual-env]: https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/#using-pip-in-a-python-virtual-environment

!!! note
    The command lines below are executed while inside your `Python` project directory

=== ":fontawesome-brands-windows: **Windows**"

    ```cmd title="Windows cmd"
    # Make the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

=== ":material-git: **Git Bash**"

    ```bash title="Git Bash Windows"
    # Make the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

=== ":fontawesome-brands-linux: **Linux/macOS**"

    ```bash title="Shell"
    # Make the virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

!!! note
    Reactivate an existing virtual environment by following the same instructions to activate.  There is no need to create a new virtual environment.

## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.

## Build Site

Before deploying the `MkDocs` project to the web, you must first build the documentation.

```cmd title="Windows cmd"
mkdocs build
```

This will create a new directory in your project called `site`. To view the content of the directory.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-windows: **Windows**"

    ```cmd title="Windows cmd"
    dir site
    ```

=== ":fontawesome-brands-linux: **Linux/macOS**"

    ```bash title="Shell"
    ls site
    ```
